    - in the grouping of results there are some problems that need some debugging
    - e.g. in the results for Book 6, lines 601-650, line 6.595 shows up
    - this may be due to lines spanning over multiple lines but need to be checked
* check issue with unicode encoding of json data (`quot_freq.json`)
